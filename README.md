-   This [üöÄ FoodZone App üòç](https://foodfire-app.netlify.app/) is build from scratch using React.js and Vite.

Note: To Fix the `CORS` Issue in [FoodZone App](https://foodfire-app.netlify.app/), I have created [FoodZone Server](https://github.com/hidrag/food-zone-server) a GitHub Repository, which gives own server URL. For Instance: `https://food-zone-server.onrender.com`

## üî• Clone this Repository

You need to write the following commands on the terminal screen(in vscode) so that you can run this project locally.

```bash
  git clone "https://github.com/hidrag/food-zone-server.git"
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Food-Zone
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

This application should now be running on `localhost`. If you want to Fork repository and want to run locally, follow this guidelines [Fork and Clone Github Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
